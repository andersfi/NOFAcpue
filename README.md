Documentation and codes for the Fennoscandian freswhater fish CPUE and associated information database.

Under construction: The database contains (or rather will contain) catch per unit efforth statistics for freswhater fishes in the Nordic countries (presently amitions are to cover Norway, Sweeden and Finnland). It is not the ambition to covar all test fishing events ever recorder, but a representative proportion giving the oppurtunity to analyse patterns in population structure and production across environmental gradients. Basic information is number and weight of fish caught, where, when on which type of sampling gear. Additional information is aggregated length and age distribution and mean growth of the population (back-calculated or empirical). Also, water chemistry et al. and fish species composition at the time of sampling may be recorded.  

### Structure and coding
The datgabase is as far as possible made complying with [Darwin Core](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm). Preliminary naming of fields and translation from data-sources can be found on [google spreadsheets](https://goo.gl/rn9LX8). Innputt data are located in the INVAFISH/gillNetData/GillnetCPUEdata dropbox folder (only accessible to project partners). 

### Data access
The data origin either from public databases, litterature surveys or donated by individual data-owners. The accessability of the data range from "in the public domain" to "not be used without agreement with orignal data donor". Details are given for each datapoint in the field ["accessRigths"](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#dcterms:accessRights), with contact information of data owner in the field ["rigthsHolder"](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#dcterms:rightsHolder)

### Finances
The main structure and collation of data is financed by projects funded by the Norwegian Research Council (INVAFISH, Hydrobalance, BiWa). The raw data are gathered from litterature and from orginal sources.
